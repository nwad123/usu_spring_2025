# Lab Notes

Standard Cell Library
: A library provided by a manufacturer that specifies power, timing, etc. for a set
of standard cell blocks.

## ASIC Design Methodology

1. High level design
2. RTL design
3. System, timing, and logic verification
   - Simulation, verification, etc.
4. Physical design
   - Covered in last semesters class
5. Performance and manufacturability verification
   - Extraction of physical view
   - Verifing of timing / signal integrity
   - Design rule checking (DRC)
