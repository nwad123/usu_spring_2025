# Nonideal Transistor Theory

## ON and Off current 

$$ 
I_{on} = I_{ds} \text{ at } V_{gs} = V_{ds} = V_{DD}
$$

$$ 
I_{off} = I_{ds} \text{ at } V_{gs} = 0, V_{ds} = V_{DD}
$$

In cutoff, there is actually still a _very small_ current that passes through the 
transistor, even though the transistor is "off". This is called _leakage current_ 
and leads to _leakage power_ as well.
